# Revit Hotel Project


This project is a hotel model created in Autodesk Revit as part of my ongoing journey in learning Building Information Modeling (BIM). I am following a step-by-step tutorial to understand how to create professional architectural layouts, structural elements, and interior components using Revit’s tools and workflows.

The goal of this project is not to design a specific real-world hotel, but to practice Revit fundamentals, improve my drafting/modelling skills, and gain confidence working with professional architectural modeling software.

## Project Goals
- Learn the fundamentals of Autodesk Revit
- Understand BIM concepts such as families, levels, components, and constraints
- Practice modeling a complete building from start to finish
- Explore architectural detailing and interior layout design
- Improve accuracy and speed in Revit’s 3D and 2D workflows

## Notes
This is a learning project, not a final professional architectural design. The focus is to develop foundational Revit skills while following structured tutorials.
